# Linear Regression
Here is the code of linear regression implemented from scratch. The code is meant to develop a more in depth learning of how linear regression algorithm works.

## Libraries:
Here the main libraries you will need are:
  * Numpy (this will allow matrix and vectors operations)
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib
## Mathematical Concepts:
The algorithm uses simple linear algebric concepts to handle matrix and vectors. The optimization step makes use of gradient descent to find the global minima.
