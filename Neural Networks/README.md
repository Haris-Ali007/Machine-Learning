# Neural Network
Here is the code of Neural Network implemented from scratch. The code is meant to develop a more in depth learning of how Nerual Network or MultilayerPreceptron is designed and  works.

## Libraries:
Here the main libraries you will need are:
  * Numpy (this will allow matrix and vectors operations)
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib
## Important Concepts:
  * Matrix Calculation
  * Vectorization
  * Backpropagation
## Data File:
Data files are in the machine learning repository mentioned as:
  * Train Data File : train_catvnoncat.h5 
  * Test Data File : test_catvnoncat.h5
